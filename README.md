A Polygon clipper for JavaFX

Polygon Clipper is a library to execute various boolean operations (Union, Difference, XOR, etc.) on arbitrary 2D polygons, e.g. calculate the area in which two polygons overlap. It comes with two Demo applications, one for the console and one using a Swing based GUI.

It’s a 1:1 Java portation of the Clipper project developed by <a href="http://www.angusj.com/delphi/clipper.php">Angus Johnson</a>, which as an implementation of the algorithm proposed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatti_clipping_algorithm">Bala R. Vatti</a>. I just converted the code to Java 8, based on his C# Clipper version 6.2.1. If you’re interested in the documentation or have questions regarding the algorithm, please head over to his homepage. However, feel free to contact me if you found a bug or have a question regarding the Java version.

todo: Will convert AWT to JavaFX graphics. Jim Kay.
